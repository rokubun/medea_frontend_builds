# medea_frontend_builds
The purpose of this repository is to hold the build results of the MEDEA frontend & api. 
Allowing its transfer from the automated Jenkins (typically the commiter) builds towards the MEDEA targets (fetchers). 
In such a way we are able to cross-compile the frontend, saving long compilation times. 
And deploy it -with a simple git command- from any MEDEA target that will eventually serve it.
